## Abstract

Education as a human capital investment is of the utmost importance for social and economic well-being, thus evaluating the efficiency of this (usually) public investment is crucial. In this paper we examine the efficiency of a sample of a combined 686 schools in the Visegrad countries using the 2018 PISA survey data. We employ an innovative nonparametric approach that combines both the benefits of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), namely the Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (henceforth as StoNED) developed in @kuosmanen2012. We construct 4 different models to control for returns to scale, contextual(nondiscretionary) input variables, as well as the inclusion of undesirable and multioutputs. These models are applied country-wise and accroos all 4 countries in order to compare their efficiency frontiers.

We use 4 different models, to highlight the return to scale, capture contextual variables' effect on the efficiency scores and incorporate multiple outputs including undesirable outputs namely the dropout rates. This analysis in conducted across the Visegrad countries and within each one of them.

School-level inefciencies and mismanagement can have serious repercussions for human resource development and labor market outcomes

Performance in the education sector is of interest in terms of its share of private and public expenditures as well as its key policy relevance through its links to human capital, growth and innovation.
